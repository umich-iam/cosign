	common: TCP_NODELAY on by default in daemon, filters, and cgi,
                and off by default in monster. This should cause a

		possibly non-reentrant calls)
	filters: fixed bug with PostErrorRedirect - it works, now.
	filters: logging now using ap_log_error() so it's more syslog-esque.
	filters: fixed bug in apache2 where building with krb and then not
		getting tickets would cause garbage to be written into the
		cookie file, and the server to core dump.

		capture the browser info ( in access logs ) for clients
		who are looping.

	config: bug fix for specifying apache2 path
	common: all declarations of port are now unsigned short

	    was successfully expired.
	cgi: kerberos tickets are unlinked after successful transfer to daemon

	filter: support for cosign protecting http pages
	filter: can now force users to return to a specific URL
	html: new example login/logout pages, no longer UM specific
	html: LOGIN_ERROR_HTML is now distinct from ERROR_HTML so
	      specific login errors can all include login screen and
	      fatal errors (where login is not possible) will not
	      include a login screen. The files in cosign_src/html/ are
	      login_error.m4 and error.m4 respectively.  This will
	      require a change to your existing html if you are
	      upgrading from a previous version.
